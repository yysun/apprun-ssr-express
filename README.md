## AppRun SSR Example using Express

This demo application uses [AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun) as the backend view engine for express. It is also a single page application (SPA).

You can remix it on @glitch https://apprun-ssr-express.glitch.me/

## To run local

* Use _npm start_ to start the server (or F5 in vs code)
* http://localhost:3000
* Use _npm run build_ to build
